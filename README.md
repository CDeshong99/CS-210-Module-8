# CS-210-Module-8

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project aimed to create a program for a local grocer to analyze the frequency of items purchased, using data from an input file. The program addressed the need for efficient tracking and visualization of purchase frequencies, making it easier for the grocer to identify trends. It included features like searching for specific item frequencies, displaying all items with their counts, generating histograms, and backing up the data into a frequency.dat file.

# What did you do particularly well?
I was particularly proud of how I structured the code to be both modular and easy to understand. Each feature—like displaying a histogram or writing the data to a file—was encapsulated in its own function, making the program straightforward to read and maintain. Additionally, error handling for file operations ensured that the program behaved predictably even when the input file was missing or invalid.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
There’s room to enhance the program in a few key ways:
Input Validation: While the program handles invalid menu choices, adding more robust input validation for user inputs (like catching non-string characters for item names) would improve user experience.
Efficiency: Currently, the input file is read in full every time the program starts. For larger datasets, caching the data or optimizing the map structure could make this more efficient.
Security: The program could sanitize inputs more rigorously to avoid potential issues with unexpected file or user inputs. For example, escaping special characters in item names when writing to frequency.dat.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part was handling the input file and ensuring the program gracefully exited or notified the user when the file couldn’t be found or opened. I overcame this by adding robust error messages and using a simple exit(1) strategy to prevent the program from continuing in an unstable state. To overcome conceptual hurdles, I relied on resources like C++ documentation, forums, and previous coursework examples.

This project encouraged me to better familiarize myself with tools like the Visual Studio debugger for troubleshooting and GitHub for version control. I also found online communities like Stack Overflow invaluable for researching best practices and debugging techniques.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project enhanced my ability to break down a problem into smaller, modular tasks, which is a skill applicable to almost any coding project. Working with file input/output and basic data structures like maps will also transfer directly to future projects, particularly those involving data processing or analysis.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I focused on writing clear, self-documenting code by using descriptive variable and function names. I also added inline comments to explain the purpose of each function and any complex logic. By structuring the code into reusable functions, it’s easier to add new features or adapt the program for different datasets. If the grocer wanted to add new data analysis capabilities in the future, the program’s modularity would make it straightforward to implement.
